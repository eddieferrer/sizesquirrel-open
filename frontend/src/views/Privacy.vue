          <h5>About cookies</h5>
          <p>
            This website uses cookies. By using this website and agreeing to this policy, you
            consent to SizeSquirrel's use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.
            The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page
            from the server. This enables a web server to identify and track web browsers. There are
            two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are
            deleted from your computer when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies
            remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach their expiry date.
            This website uses both.
          </p>
          <h5>Refusing cookies</h5>
          <p>
            Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. Blocking cookies will have a
            negative impact upon the usability of this website, but you are free to do so.
          </p>
          <h5>Information Use</h5>
          <p>
            We use your information for internal marketing and promotional purposes. We may use your
            information, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, special
            offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we
            think may interest you. We will also use your email address information to respond to
            inquiries or requests.

          <h5>Information Disclosure</h5>
          <p>We do not disclose or sell any of your information to any third parties.</p>
