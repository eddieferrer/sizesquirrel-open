        <strong>I can't find my shoe on the site!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please send us an email at,
        <a
          data-name="eddie"
          data-domain="sizesquirrel"
          data-tld="com"
          href="#"
          class="cryptedmail"
          onclick="window.location.href = 'mailto:' + this.dataset.name + '@' + this.dataset.domain + '.' + this.dataset.tld"
          >email</a
        >
        and we will add the shoe to the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why is there no picture for a certain shoe?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of shoes on SizeSquirrel, and manually acquiring each picture would be an
        enormous task. For now, we are gathering the images from our affiliate network. So if your
        shoe is not currently for sale with our affiliate partners, then it probably will not have a
        picture associated with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What about older models of the shoes?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that previous shoe models may be different. Because our images are gathered
        from the current models on sale, we don't have a reliable source to gather the images for
        old or discontinued models. We understand this is a problem, but haven't yet come up with a
        good solution to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can I support the site?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        SizeSquirrel is completely free, and would like to stay that way. It does cost us money and
        time to keep the site running. If you would like to support the site, please just tell a
        friend about it, or use the
        <RouterLink to="/sales">Climbing Shoes On Sale!</RouterLink>&nbsp;page next time you are in
        the market for new climbing shoes.
