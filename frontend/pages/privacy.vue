          <h5>About cookies</h5>
          <p>
            This website uses cookies. By using this website and agreeing to
            this policy, you consent to SizeSquirrel's use of cookies in
            accordance with the terms of this policy. The information is then
            sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from
            the server. This enables a web server to identify and track web
            browsers. There are two main kinds of cookies: session cookies and
            persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted from your computer
            when you close your browser, whereas persistent cookies remain
            stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach their
            expiry date. This website uses both.
          </p>
          <h5>Refusing cookies</h5>
          <p>
            Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. Blocking
            cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of this
            website, but you are free to do so.
          </p>
          <h5>Information Use</h5>
          <p>
            We use your information for internal marketing and promotional
            purposes. We may use your information, such as your email address,
            to send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or
            to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may
            interest you. We will also use your email address information to
            respond to inquiries or requests.
          </p>
          <h5>Information Disclosure</h5>
          <p>
            We do not disclose or sell any of your information to any third

          <h5>Plug-ins and Social Media Widgets</h5>
          <p>
            The site may include social media features and widgets, such as the
            Facebook buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which
            page you are visiting on our Site and may set a cookie to enable the
            feature to function properly and for purposes. These features are
            displayed on our Site, but are hosted by third parties, and are

          <p>
            We have implemented safeguards to protect the personal information
            submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
            method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or
            method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. You should take your
            own steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password
